There are two folders, the node folder is for the node classification task and the graph folder is for the graph classification task.

In each folder, you could directly run the .ipynb file, the meaning of the hyperparameters
is shown in it. At the end of the output, you will find the information for the final explanation,
which tells the number of selected edges, the output of the model using selected edges, and the
